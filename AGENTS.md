# AGENTS.md

work style: telegraph; noun-phrases ok; drop grammar; min tokens.

> bootstrap context only. discoverable from codebase → don't put here.
> corrections + patterns → LESSONS_LEARNED.md.

## Constraints

<!-- non-obvious, needed BEFORE exploring. keep minimal. -->

## Legacy & Deprecated

<!-- codebase parts that actively mislead. -->

## Learning System

Every session:
1. start: read `LESSONS_LEARNED.md`
2. during: note surprises
3. end: append `ITERATION_LOG.md`
4. reusable insight? → also add `LESSONS_LEARNED.md`
5. same issue 2+ times in log? → promote to `LESSONS_LEARNED.md`
6. surprise? → flag to developer (they decide: fix codebase / update LESSONS_LEARNED / adjust this file)

| File | Purpose | Write When |
|------|---------|------------|
| `LESSONS_LEARNED.md` | curated wisdom + corrections | reusable insight gained |
| `ITERATION_LOG.md` | raw session journal, append-only | every iteration |

Rules: never delete from ITERATION_LOG. Obsolete lessons → Archive in LESSONS_LEARNED. Date-stamp YYYY-MM-DD. When in doubt: log it.

### Periodic Maintenance
Config files audited periodically via `SETUP_AI_AGENT_CONFIG.md`.
