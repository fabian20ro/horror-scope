# Horror-Scope

*Your Browser Knows Your Destiny*

A funny and absurd horoscope generator that reads your browser like a crystal ball. It assigns you a zodiac sign based on your browser fingerprint, then delivers a personalized daily horoscope full of cosmic nonsense — because your browser already knows everything about you.

## Features

- **Browser divination** — your zodiac sign is determined by your browser fingerprint (UA, language, screen, platform, timezone). Same browser, same destiny
- **Daily absurd horoscopes** — generated through a context-free grammar engine with hundreds of mystical/ridiculous sentence fragments. Same sign gets the same horoscope each day
- **Bilingual** — Romanian (auto-detected from browser language) and English, with a flag toggle to switch
- **Light + dark theme** — because the stars shine differently depending on your mood
- **Mobile-first** — responsive design that looks good on any screen
- **Installable as a PWA** — add it to your home screen for daily cosmic guidance
- **"We know everything about you"** — an expandable panel that reveals all the browser properties used for your divination

## Tech

Vanilla TypeScript, Vite, zero runtime dependencies. The entire horoscope engine — grammar expansion, seeded PRNG, browser fingerprinting — runs client-side with no backend.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # local dev server
npm run build    # production build
```
